# Fall/Spring Semester Labs
Set of R labs for Stat 231

For our first lab day, you will need to download and install R and RStudio. Links are below. If you have a Chromebook please let me know asap as you will be unable to download these.
If you have trouble doing so, we will spend some time at the start of our first lab making sure everyone is able to get the software working. 

R -
Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/

Mac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

Linux: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/

RStudio -
https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

For RStudio, select the "Desktop Free" version. The website will detect your operating system and provide the correct download link. 

Read through the "lab_0.html" file to get familiar with the interface of RStudio and, if you feel up to it, try to follow along with the code segments. We will go over the code segments on the first lab day so no stress about doing those beforehand.
