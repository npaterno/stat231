# Fall/Spring Semester Labs
Set of R labs for Stat 231 at Pacific Lutheran University. 

The labs are meant to give a brief introduction to some of the many uses of *R* for statistical computing including data summaries, data visualization, inferential statistics and least squares regression. 

Each lesson is available as a vignette; We'll go over how to get to them during our first lab session. 

Each assignment is available as an rmarkdown template. Once complete, you should knit your document and submit the resulting html (or pdf) file via email.
